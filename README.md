## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Mohammad Abed Rabbo, a Software Engineering student at ORT College.  
My ambition is to become a developer who leaves a real impact in the world of programming.  
I love challenges, learn quickly, and enjoy working in a team under pressure.

🎯 I'm interested in app development, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), data analysis, and quality assurance (both manual and automation).  
🧠 Currently working on my final project **"Sentimentor"**, a smart system for monitoring elderly health using a wearable device and AI.  
🌟 I'm open to job or internship opportunities to gain real-world experience.
